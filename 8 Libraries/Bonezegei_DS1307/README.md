### Arduino Library for I2C Real Time Clock

The Bonezegei DS1307 is an Arduino library for interfacing with the DS1307 real time clock chip. The library provides functions to read and write the clock time. The library is based on the datasheet of the DS1307 chip from Analog Devices (Analog Devices, 2015). The library is compatible with all Arduino architectures and can be installed from the Arduino library manager. The library also depends on the Wire library for I2C communication.
